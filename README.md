## Introduction
### What is Gamma Simulator?

Gamma simulator is a gamma pulse simulator with parameter customization function, you can specify the type of radioactive source and pulse count rate and other characteristics, generate pulse signals that meet the corresponding characteristics

### Why do we creat it?

The original intention of the gamma simulator was to introduce deep learning into energy spectroscopy in the later stage. The use of deep learning to process pulse signals requires that the collected pulse signals have corresponding labels, which is impossible in commercial energy spectrometer. Therefore, we used the simulator to label the pulse signals while generating them, so as to facilitate the reference of deep learning methods. At the same time, simulators can greatly reduce the manpower, material and financial resources of the signal collection process, and can be used to preliminarily test signal processing methods

**The above parameters can be set and customized by users. The chart shows the default values of parameters and draws discrete pulse signals.

### Parametric image
![paraima](./fig/parameterpic.png)
1. Pulse Shape: Representing the shape of each pulse, our simulator can simulate pulses of gamma shape and double exponential shape, as determined by the parameter **dict_type**, Pulse 1 is selected from the shape dictionary as shown in the image below
![shapes](./fig/shapes.png)
In this figure, 1.1 represents the number of pulse shapes contained in the pulse shape dictionary, as determined by the **dict_size** parameter,1.2 represents the pulse length, including the pulse rise time and pulse fall time, which are determined by the **dict_shape_params** parameter

2. Pulse interval time: The time interval between two pulses, which is randomly generated by the Poisson process is determined by parameter **lambda_value**.More informally, lambda_value represents the average number of pulses arriving per second

3. Noise: The noise of the signal is present in every moment of the signal is determined by the **noise_unit** and **noise** parameters.If we zoom in on 3 we get the image below
![noise](./fig/noise.png)
Where the unit of noise is "std", 3.1 clearly represents the amplitude of the noise determined by the parameter **noise**
## Use
### Install
Make sure you have the following libraries in your environment
* numpy
* scipy
* matplotlib
* urllib  
(It doesn't matter that you don't have these, because these dependencies will be installed when you install the gamma-simulator package)

Please use the following command to install our program
```bash
pip install gamma-simulator
```
### Import
```python
from gamma_simulator.gamma_simulator import gamma_simulator
```

### Run
Step 1.Creat an instance
```python
simulator = gamma_simulator()
```
Step 2.Define parameters
```python
simulator = gamma_simulator(verbose=True,
                            verbose_plots={'shapes': True, 'signal': True},
                            source={'name': 'Co-60', 'weights': 1},
                            signal_len=1, 
                            fs=10e5,
                            lambda_value=1e4,
                            dict_type='gamma',
                            dict_shape_params={'mean1':  0.1,
                                               'std1': 0.001,
                                               'mean2': 1e5,
                                               'std2': 1e3},
                            noise_unit='std',
                            noise=1e-3,
                            dict_size=10,
                            seed=42)
```
Step 3.Creat the signal
```python
signal = simulator.generate_signal()
```


## Notice
### Shape parameter
If you are not familiar with shape parameters, use the following combination of parameters
```python
dict_type='gamma',
dict_shape_params={'mean1':  0.1,
'std1': 0.001,
'mean2': 1e5,
'std2': 1e3}
```
or
```python
dict_type='double_exponential',
dict_shape_params={'mean1': 1e-5, 
'std1': 1e-7,
'mean2': 1e-7,
'std2': 1e-9}
```
### Plot setting
Our simulator supports drawing a variety of graphs, including energy, shape, signal and spectrum.
* Energy: Ideal energy spectrum of the drawn signal source (simulator built-in database)
* Shape: Draws a dictionary set of all possible signal shapes
* Signal: When the length of the resulting signal is less than 2000, the generated signal is drawn, and when the length is greater than 2000, the first 2000 sampling points are drawn


The default option is not to draw, if you need to draw, you need to change the specified value in the parameter definition to True
```
verbose_plots={'energy':True, 'shapes': True, 'signal': True}
```
## Example

```python
from gamma_simulator.gamma_simulator import gamma_simulator
simulator = gamma_simulator(verbose=True,
                            verbose_plots={'shapes': True, 'signal': True},
                            source={'name': 'Co-60', 'weights': 1},
                            signal_len=1,  
                            fs=10e6,
                            lambda_value=1e4,
                            dict_type='double_exponential',
                            dict_shape_params={'mean1': 1e-5,  
                                               'std1': 1e-7,
                                               'mean2': 1e-7,
                                               'std2': 1e-9},
                            noise_unit='std',
                            noise=1e-3,

## Known issue
  * Cannot simulate high count rates（The length of each pulse is too long）
  * The setting of the pulse length time parameter is too supervisor
## Todo 
  * Use simulators to generate datasets for deep learning
  * (Possibly) Try to give a way to set parameters so that users can customize them to their needs
